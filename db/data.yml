    - iMac
    - |-
      The iMac is a range of all-in-one Macintosh desktop computers designed and built by Apple Inc. It has been the primary part of Apple's consumer desktop offerings since its introduction in 1998, and has evolved through five distinct forms.[1]
      In its original form, the iMac G3 had a gum-drop or egg-shaped look, with a CRT monitor, mainly enclosed by a colored, translucent plastic case, which was refreshed early on with a sleeker design notable for its slot-loaded optical drive. The second major revision, the iMac G4, moved the design to a hemispherical base containing all the main components and an LCD monitor on a freely moving arm attached to it. The third/fourth major revision, the iMac G5 and the Intel iMac placed all the components immediately behind the display, creating a slim unified design that tilts only up and down on a simple metal base. The current iMac shares the same form as the previous model, but is thinner and uses anodized aluminum and a glass panel over the entire front. In addition it also added a SDXC slot directly under the Slot-Loading SuperDrive. Newer versions are available with a solid state drive instead of a hard drive. The newest version features quad-core Intel processors across the line, 1 (on 21.5") or 2 (on 27") Thunderbolt ports, and a FaceTime HD camera, features introduced on the early 2011 MacBook Pro updates.

    - Mac Pro
    - |
      The Mac Pro is a workstation computer manufactured by Apple Inc.. The machines are based on Xeon microprocessors, but are similar to the Power Mac G5 they replaced in terms of outward appearance and expansion capabilities. The Mac Pro, in most configurations, is the fastest computer that Apple offers and one of three desktop computers in the current Macintosh lineup, the other two being the iMac and Mac Mini.
      The first Mac Pro was based on dual Dual-core Xeon Woodcrest processors and formally announced on August 7, 2006 at WWDC.[3] A new Intel Xeon-based Xserve was announced along with the Mac Pro, completing Apple's transition from the PowerPC to x86 architecture.

    - iPod Classic
    - |
      The iPod Classic (trademarked, marketed, and stylized as iPod classic and known before its sixth generation as simply iPod) is a portable media player marketed by Apple Inc. The current generation is by far the most capacious iPod, with 160GB of storage.
      To date, there have been six generations of the iPod, as well as a spin-off (the iPod Photo) that was later re-integrated into the main iPod line. (Some sources refer to the revisions of the sixth generation as a separate "seventh generation."[1]) All generations use a 1.8-inch (46 mm) hard drive for storage. The "classic" suffix was introduced with the introduction of the sixth-generation iPod on September 5, 2007;[2] prior to this, all iPod models were simply referred to as iPods.[3] It is available in silver or black replacing the "signature iPod white".

    - Mac Mini
    - "The Mac Mini (trademarked as Mac mini) is a small form factor desktop computer manufactured by Apple Inc. Like earlier mini-ITX PC designs, it is uncommonly small for a desktop computer: 7.7 inches (19.7 cm) square and 1.4 inches (3.6 cm) tall. It weighs 2.7 pounds (1.22 kg). Models prior to July 2011 included a built-in optical disc drive. Models prior to 2010 used an external power supply and were smaller at 2 \xC3\x97 6.5 \xC3\x97 6.5 inches). The Mac mini is currently one of three desktop computers in the current Macintosh lineup, the other two being the iMac and Mac Pro.\r\n\
      The Mac mini was the first recent Macintosh desktop to ship without a keyboard or mouse. In addition, there is no included display. The primary intended market for the Mac mini was for \"switchers\" (users moving from a traditional Windows PC to Mac) who would already own a compatible display, keyboard, and mouse. Other customers could easily purchase these if needed.[5] A special version of the computer is also intended for use as a server in a small network. It includes Lion Server and has a second hard drive."

    - MacBook Air
    - |-
      The MacBook Air family is a line of Apple ultraportable Macintosh notebook computers.
      The first MacBook Air was a 13.3" model, promoted as the 'World's Thinnest Notebook', that was introduced at the Macworld Conference & Expo on January 15, 2008.[4] The original MacBook Air featured a custom[5] Intel Merom CPU plus Intel GMA graphics that was updated to faster non-custom Penryn CPU and Nvidia GeForce graphics in late 2008. In addition, the hard drive capacity was increased and the micro-DVI video port was replaced with a Mini DisplayPort.[6][7] A mid-2009 refresh, introduced alongside the MacBook Pro family, featured a slightly higher-capacity battery, and a faster Penryn CPU option.[8]
